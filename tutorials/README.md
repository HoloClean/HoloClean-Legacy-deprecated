# Repairing Erroneous Hospital Data

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of using HoloClean to clean a dataset with a significant amount of errors. We have broken this tutorial up into 3 separate notebooks, each discussing a different aspect of the problem.

1. **Data Loading & Denial Constraints[[Tutorial_1](Tutorial_1.ipynb)]:**
First, we introduce the infrastructure of HoloClean and the primary source of information we use to perform repairs, Denial Constraints.

2. **Complete Pipeline Through HoloClean[[Tutorial_2](Tutorial_2.ipynb)]:**
Next, we run an end-to-end pipeline of repairing the hospital dataset using our built-in modules.

3. **Writing Custom Error Detectors[[Tutorial_3](Tutorial_3.ipynb)]:**
We present a guide to building custom error detection tools to better fit specific problems and datasets.

4. **Performance Evaluation[[Tutorial_4](Tutorial_4.ipynb)]:**
Finally, a look at Holoclean's built-in methods to evaluate its performance.
