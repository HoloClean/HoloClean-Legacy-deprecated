    "# Introduction to Denial Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "HoloClean's goal is to clean your data, and the system is driven by a description of what clean data *should not* be like. These are expressed in the form of a Denial Constraint, which is similar to a functional dependency. However functional dependencies express things that should hold for your data, a denial constraint expresses what clean data is not like.\n",
    "## An Example: The Hospital Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk through one of the Denial Constraints used in the Hospital Dataset. The data has the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "index,\n",
    "ProviderNumber,\n",
    "HospitalName,\n",
    "Address1,\n",
    "Address2,\n",
    "Address3,\n",
    "City,\n",
    "State,\n",
    "ZipCode,\n",
    "CountyName,\n",
    "PhoneNumber,\n",
    "HospitalType,\n",
    "HospitalOwner,\n",
    "EmergencyService,\n",
    "Condition,\n",
    "MeasureCode,\n",
    "MeasureName,\n",
    "Score,\n",
    "Sample,\n",
    "Stateavg`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And we know that there are some errors in our data. For example some people have mistyped the city name, and so we see results like\n",
    "\n",
    "|City|ZipCode|\n",
    "|----|-------|\n",
    "|Chicago|60607|\n",
    "|Cicago| 60607|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that roughly whenever the zip codes are the same, the city should be the same. In the language of functional dependencies we could write this as: for any records $t_1, t_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t_1.ZipCode = t_2.ZipCode \\implies t_1.City = t_2.City$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However the HoloClean denial constraint will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "`t1&t2&EQ(t1.ZipCode,t2.ZipCode)&IQ(t1.City,t2.City)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down how this works:`t1&t2` specifies that two records will be involved in the error. `EQ(t1.ZipCode, t2.ZipCode)&IQ(t1.City, t2.City)` says that the records will have equal zip codes, but inequal cities. Now any pairs of records in the hospital dataset which make this true will be marked as potentially dirty.\n",
