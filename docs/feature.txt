Featurization
===============

Holoclean uses different signals to create the features for the model that it will use for the learning part. We've provided three kinds of signals: `SignalInit`, `SignalDC`, `SignalCooccur`. HoloClean also support custom or user-defined signal by creating a new class that inherits from `Featurizer` and overrides the required methods.
